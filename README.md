Changed the Title of the webpage to: Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

Changed the div class = footer to just <footer> so that webpage scanners can rad the footer.

I noticed that change made the items in footer uncentered, I might go back and change that later for a better flow to the eye.

Changed <div class="header"> to just <header>.
Changed the <div> inside the header to <nav>.
I did both of those changes to make the webapge more SEO friendly, so that webpage scanners can find the header and navigation bar.


Since most of the font is ( font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;) on the page I put that at the top of the CSS under the * (which selects all elements) section so I could remove it from: .header, .benefits, .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing 

Added nav class to UL so it would recognize the CSS.

I moved the  "list-style-type: none;" to the .nav section, so that I could remove .nav ul.

Added <div id="search-engine-optimization">, so that the link would work, by knowing where to go on the page when the link is pushed.
